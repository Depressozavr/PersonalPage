    <p>
        This page is about me. I think that I don't need to introduce myself due to all the titles and content in meta
        tags that you've already seen. On this page you can read some information about me, my studying, hobbies
        etc.

        <h2>Brief information</h2>
        <p>
            My birthday is <time datetime="2003-10-13">October 13th</time>. I was born in 2003 in Rostov-on-Don, so now I am 19 years old. Now I am living
            in the Taganrog, where I also study.

        <h2>My studying</h2>
        <p>
            First place where I've studied was initial training school where I went in the age of 5. Then I went to school,
            finished it and went to the university. For now, I am also interning in the IT-company <span class='Lachestry'>"Lachestry"</span>.
        </p>
        <br>
        So my <strong>"studying"</strong> part of the life I can split into this parts:
        <ol type="I">
            <li>Pre-intermediate school</li>
            <li>School</li>
            <li>University</li>
            <li>Web-developer internship</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In the table below I will mention some information that should be specified but is not that big to give her
            a separate paragraph
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <td>Studying place</td>
                    <td>Name</td>
                    <td>Years studied</td>
                </tr>
            </thead>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            So now is the time to tell about my hobbies. I'll tell you a bit about them below but at first I want to
            name them.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Programming</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Listening to music</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Programming</strong> is one of my hobbies, but it's also a sphere where I am studying and want to work.
            I really like it, the king of programming that I like is Back-end web-development. Of course there are plenty
            of others great directions in the programming but web development is my favourite one. It's the sphere in
            which I want to work.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Reading</strong>: I really like to read. It's so great to lie on the sofa with the book and just read.
            I read a lot if I have time for that. I buy only paper books because I don't like e-books they don't give me same
            feelings as paper books do. Beside that by buying paper books I can make some library at home what I am trying to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Listening to music></strong>Last thing that I've mentioned was listening to <strong>music</strong>.
            It's not really a hobby, but I really
            like to do it.
        </p>
